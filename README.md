# D&D CLI

A command line tool intended to help guide a D&D Dungeon Master (especially a new one) through the key mechanics of the game. This tool is *not* intended to automate gameplay elements - rolling dice and using the imagination are fun. Instead it aims to automate remembering the rules themselves so that a Dungeon Master can concentrate on crafting the story.
